        <h1>ABOUT CALL OF DUTY: MOBILE</h1>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
       	<h3>What is Call of Duty: Mobile?</h3>
        	<p>Call of Duty: Mobile is a free-to-play shooter game developed by TiMi Studio Group and published by Activision for Android and iOS. The game was released on October 1, 2019. It saw one of the largest mobile game launches in history, generating over US$480 million with 270 million downloads within a year. Call of Duty: Mobile was published in other regions by Garena, Tencent Games, VNG Games and TiMi Studio Group.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Development and Release</h3>
        	<p>Call of Duty: Mobile was announced in March 2019, with TiMi-J3, itself a TiMi Studio Group division, which is a subsidiary of Tencent Games, leading development. Many of the game's features were revealed at this announcement, promising a familiar experience for fans of the console games. The aim of the game was to take familiar aspects from the franchise's previous games and allow users to access them from their mobile devices. It features two in-game currencies, as well as a battle pass. The initial release was in Australia on June 15, 2019, following the soft-launches in Australia, Canada and Peru. Garena released the game in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan & Thailand on September 29, 2019. The game was released in Europe, North America and Latin America by Activision on September 30, 2019, and by Tencent Games in South Korea on October 1, 2019. VNG Games released the game after the worldwide release in partnership with Activision and TiMi Studios in Vietnam on April 20, 2020. Tencent Games published the game for Mainland China on December 24, 2020.</p>

		<p>Call of Duty: Mobile features many playable characters, maps, and game modes from previous games in the series. Different control settings were included to cater to player's preferences. A "zombies" game mode was added to the game in November 2019. This game mode followed the classic Call of Duty zombies "survival" formula where the player fights off endless waves of zombies, aiming to survive as long as possible. A "Raid" mode was also included where the player had to defeat a set amount of waves of zombies before encountering one of two final bosses. Call of Duty: Mobile Zombies mode was removed on March 25, 2020, due to the game mode not meeting Activision's standards.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        	<p>Players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches in multiplayer mode. It has two types of in-game currencies: "Credits", which are earned through playing the game, and "COD Points", which have to be bought with real world money. It is possible to play the full game without paying, though some exclusive character and weapon skins can only be bought with COD Points. Apart from standard matchmaking, a private room for both the multiplayer and battle royale modes can also be accessed where players can invite and battle with their in-game friends.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
        	<p>The multiplayer mode is the basic first-person shooter, similar to previous Call of Duty games on other platforms, along with old maps. The core game modes include Team Deathmatch, Domination, Free for All, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, etc. The game also has "Scorestreaks", which are special weapons that are available as the player reaches certain times and points. Additionally, the game features special and limited multiplayer modes that may last for days, weeks, or a whole game season. These include: Prop Hunt, Rapid Fire, Sticks and Stones, 2v2, Capture the Flag, One Shot One Kill, Snipers Only, and Gun Game, and Attack of the Undead among others.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Battle Royale</h3>
        	<p>The game also includes battle royale modes featuring up to 100 players. A player can choose to play alone, on a two-man team, or in a four-man squad. At the start of a game, all players choose an ability from healing to making a launch pad. Once all 100 people are ready, they get aboard a plane that flies in a straight line over the map. This flight path changes every game. Every team is automatically given a jump leader who decides when and where the team will land. At the beginning of the game, each player carries only a knife. The map has weapons, vehicles, and items which players can find and use to improve their chances of killing enemies while staying alive themselves. The mode has high tier loot zones (marked in yellow on the map) that provide players with better items. The safe zone on the map shrinks as the game progresses, with players who remain outside the zone being killed if they stay outside for too long. A player or team wins the game if they are the last one remaining. Particularly, battle royale also has limited modes like 20v20 Warfare, and Battle Royale Blitz.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Zombies</h3>
        	<p>A Zombies mode was added in November 2019. It placed teams of players against zombies that attacked in waves. It was playable in Endless Survival Mode, which ran like the classic zombie experience, and Raid Mode, which threw a set number of waves at the players before transitioning to a boss encounter. The players could choose whether to play it on Normal or Heroic difficulty. The mode was removed in March 2020 due to it not reaching the desired level of quality. Undead Siege, a zombie survival mode, was added into the game in August 2021. In it a team of four players have to survive and protect their teleportation device from continuous waves of zombies. During the day, players have to collect supplies which would be used during the night to survive against a horde of zombies. In addition, players during the day also take part on a mission called Daytime Side Missions, which includes the Butcher, and breaking the Aether Crystal Cluster.</p>
